# Goal Reprioritization

**English:** Goal reprioritization means adjusting or changing the order of testing objectives during an engagement when new findings or situations arise.

**Urdu:** Yani penetration test ke dauran agar naye critical issues mil jayein ya environment change ho jaye, to pentester apne goals ko dobara prioritize karta hai taa ke sabse pehle critical cheez pe focus ho.

## When Reprioritization is Needed?

Discovery of Critical Vulnerabilities

**English:** If a high-severity issue (like RCE, privilege escalation) is found, focus shifts to analyzing it fully before continuing with lower-risk items.

**Urdu:** Agar bohot dangerous vulnerability mil jaye to sabse pehle usay cover karna aur client ko escalate karna zaroori hai.

### Business Priorities Change

**English:** Client may change focus — e.g., instead of internal network, they want web apps tested urgently.

**Urdu:** Kabhi client ke business priorities change ho jati hain, to tester ko apna focus accordingly adjust karna hota hai.

### Unexpected Issues

**English:** Service disruptions, unauthorized access, or environment limitations can force reprioritization.

**Urdu:** Agar testing me unexpected problems (jaise service down, system crash) ho jayein, to tester ko apna plan adjust karna padta hai.

### Time or Resource Constraints

**English:** If time is limited, tester focuses on the highest-risk targets first.

**Urdu:** Agar time ya resources kam hain, to sabse pehle critical aur high-risk goals complete karna zaroori hai.

### How to Reprioritize Goals

**Communicate with Client**: Always inform POC before changing priorities.

**Document Changes**: Note why goals were reprioritized.

**Focus on Risk-Based Testing:** High severity and high impact vulnerabilities come first.

**Stay Flexible:** Adjust based on findings and business context.

**Urdu:** Hamesha client ko involve karke goals reprioritize karo, changes document karo aur sabse pehle un cheezon par focus karo jo business ke liye sabse risky hain.

## Example Scenario

**Original Goal:** Test all internal servers.

**New Finding:** Critical SQL injection found in web portal.

**Reprioritization:** Stop deep internal scan → fully analyze & document SQLi → escalate to client.

### Easy Exam Recall:
**Reprioritization** = New critical findings + Business changes + Unexpected issues + Limited time/resources → Adjust goals + Communicate + Document


## Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

**English:** BIA is the process of identifying and evaluating the effects of a disruption on business operations.
**Urdu:** Yani BIA ek process hai jisme organization ye analyze karti hai ke agar systems/services band ho jayein to business pe kya asar hoga (financial, operational, reputational).

## Goals of BIA

Identify Critical Assets & Processes

**English:** Find out which systems, apps, or services are most important.

**Urdu:** Kaunse systems aur processes critical hain jo band hone par business ruk jata hai.

### Measure Impact of Downtime

**English:** Understand financial, legal, reputational, and operational damages.

**Urdu:** Downtime ka asar calculate karna (paise ka loss, customers ka trust, legal fine).

### Set Recovery Priorities

**English:** Define which services to restore first.

**Urdu:** Decide karna ke kis service ko pehle restore karna zaroori hai aur kisay baad me.

### Key Metrics in BIA

MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)

**English:** Maximum time a system can remain unavailable before it causes unacceptable damage.

**Urdu:** Kitne der tak system down reh sakta hai bina major damage ke.

### RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

**English:** Time by which a system must be restored after disruption.

 **Urdu:** Kitne time me system wapis up hona chahiye.

### RPO (Recovery Point Objective)

**English:** Maximum acceptable amount of data loss (measured in time).

**Urdu:** Kitna data loss tolerate kar sakte hain (e.g., 1 hour of transactions).

### BIA Outcomes

Prioritized list of critical systems & processes

Defined recovery strategies (backup, DR site, redundancy)

Financial estimate of downtime cost

Support for Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) & Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

### Example Scenario

Critical Process: Online payment system

**Impact:** If down for 2 hours → $50,000 revenue loss + customer complaints

**MTD:** 4 hours

**RTO:** 1 hour

**RPO:** 15 minutes

## Easy Exam Recall:

**BIA** = Identify critical processes + Measure downtime impact + Define recovery priorities

**Metrics** = MTD | RTO | RPO


# Client Acceptance

**English:** Client acceptance means the stage where the client officially reviews and approves the penetration test results, findings, and final report.

**Urdu:** Yani jab client final deliverables (report, findings, recommendations) ko dekh kar formally accept karta hai, use client acceptance kehte hain.

### Key Elements of Client Acceptance

Delivery of Final Report

**English:** Pentester submits the documented report with vulnerabilities, risk ratings, impact, and recommendations.

**Urdu:** Pentester final report client ko deta hai jisme sari vulnerabilities aur unke solutions likhe hote hain.

### Client Review & Validation

**English:** Client verifies that the report matches the scope, objectives, and agreed-upon deliverables.

**Urdu:** Client check karta hai ke jo test kiya gaya tha wo scope aur agreement ke mutabiq hai ya nahi.

### Sign-Off Process

**English:** Client formally acknowledges (sign-off) that they received and understood the results.

 **Urdu:** Ek formal approval hota hai jisme client sign karta hai ke unhe results samajh aa gaye aur accept hain.

### Knowledge Transfer & Q/A

**English:** Pentester may explain technical findings, remediation priorities, and answer client questions.

**Urdu:** Pentester findings ko explain karta hai aur client ke questions ka jawab deta hai taa ke clarity ho.

### Closure of Engagement

**English:** Once accepted, the engagement is officially closed and responsibilities (fixing issues) shift to the client.

**Urdu:** Acceptance ke baad engagement close ho jata hai aur ab responsibility client ki hoti hai ke wo vulnerabilities fix kare.

### Importance of Client Acceptance

Ensures no disputes about deliverables

Confirms scope was respected

Provides formal closure of the project

Builds trust & professional relationship

#### Example

Without Acceptance: Client later says "This vulnerability wasn’t reported!" → dispute.

With Acceptance: Signed report ensures both sides agree → no future conflict.
